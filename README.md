This project takes 2016 IRS Tax Return data and compares it to location data for America's 20 most popular fast food restaurants to draw conclusions about whether the relative wealth of an area of the US determines what kind of restaurants are popular there. There are ~180K rows in the Tax Return database and ~100K restaurant locations in the database.
